You are verifying data extracted from a Japanese invoice/receipt.

Two extraction methods produced different results for the same document.
Determine which value is correct for each disagreeing field by examining the image.

METHOD A (Regex-based OCR extraction):
{regex_result}

METHOD B (LLM multimodal extraction):
{llm_result}

DISAGREEING FIELDS:
{disagreements}

For each disagreeing field, examine the document image and determine the correct value.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Valid JSON only (no markdown fences):

{
  "vendor_name": "correct value",
  "issue_date": "YYYYMMDD",
  "amount": 12345,
  "invoice_number": "T1234567890123 or empty string",
  "corrections": [
    {
      "field": "field_name",
      "chosen": "A or B",
      "reason": "Brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- Only include fields that had disagreements.
- For each correction, explain WHY you chose A or B based on what you see in the image.
- If neither A nor B looks correct, provide your own extraction from the image.
- Amount must be an integer (no commas, no decimal).
- Date must be YYYYMMDD format.
